                Development (HRD) Sites and the Services (each as defined below).
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
                These Terms constitute a binding agreement between You and HRD, or the HRD company operating the Web
                site for the country in which You live or in which business is headquartered (“HRD”), and are deemed
                accepted by You each time that You use or access HRD Site or HRD Services. If You do not accept the
                Terms stated here, do not use the HRD Sites and the HRD Services.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
                The HRD Sites also include on-line communities and communication tools designed to facilitate valuable
                professional and personal networking ("HRD Networking") among users of the HRD Sites ("Users"). The HRD
                Sites also allow Users to create individual profiles, which may include personal information
                ("Profiles"), and to make these Profiles, or aspects thereof, public. In addition, HRD may collect
                information about You from publicly-available websites and may use this information to create a Profile
                or append it to an existing Profile.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
                HRD may revise these Terms at any time by posting an updated version to this Web page. You should visit
                this page periodically to review the most current Terms because they are binding on You.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
                Users who violate these Terms may have their access and use of the HRD Sites suspended or terminated,
                at HRD’s discretion.
